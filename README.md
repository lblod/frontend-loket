Frontend of the loket application

## Environment variables

The [ember-proxy-service](https://github.com/mu-semtech/ember-proxy-service#configure-environment-variables-in-the-frontends-container) docker image (which we use to host the frontend) supports configuring environment variables. The following options are available for the loket image.

## Releasing a new version

We use [`release-it`](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) to handle our release flow 

### Generating the changelog (optional)
At the moment the changelog is updated manually. To make this a bit easier you can generate a basic changelog based on the merged PRs with [`lerna-changelog`](https://github.com/lerna/lerna-changelog) by  adding the correct labels and updating the PR titles.

> `lerna-changelog` requires a Github [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to work properly.

The following command can  be used to generate the changelog:

`GITHUB_AUTH=your-access-token npx lerna-changelog`

### Creating a new release
Simply run `npm run release` and follow the prompts.

> If you generated the changelog using lerna-changelog you can add it to the changelog file and add it to the staged changes when release-it asks if you want to commit the changes. This will ensure that the changelog change is part of the release commit.

After the new tag is created and pushed CI will take care of building the docker image.
